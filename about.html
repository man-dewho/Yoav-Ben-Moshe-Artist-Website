                <p>My name is Yoav Ben Moshe. I was born in Israel and I currently live and work in Vienna. As a multifaceted artist, I express my creativity through both visual art and music. My primary focus is [your main art form], where I [briefly describe your style or approach]. When time allows, I also explore the world of sound, composing and performing [type of music you create].
 My work is inspired by [mention 2-3 key influences or themes]. Through my art, I aim to [describe your artistic goals or the emotions you want to evoke].
[Optional: Include a brief background, such as your artistic training or significant accomplishments]
I'm constantly evolving as an artist, pushing the boundaries of my craft and seeking new ways to blend my visual and musical expressions.
Would you like me to expand on any part of this draft or tailor it more specifically to your artistic style and background?</p>
